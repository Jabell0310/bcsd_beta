    <h1>Carrot</h1>
    <hr />
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Daucus carota is a biennial plant. In the first year, its rosette of
      leaves produces large amounts of sugars, which are stored in the taproot
      to provide energy for the plant to flower in the second year.[citation
      needed]. Soon after germination, carrot seedlings show a distinct
      demarcation between taproot and stem: the stem is thicker and lacks
      lateral roots. At the upper end of the stem is the seed leaf. The first
      true leaf appears about 10–15 days after germination. Subsequent leaves
      are alternate (with a single leaf attached to a node), spirally arranged,
      and pinnately compound, with leaf bases sheathing the stem. As the plant
      grows, the bases of the seed leaves, near the taproot, are pushed apart.
      The stem, located just above the ground, is compressed and the internodes
      are not distinct. When the seed stalk elongates for flowering, the tip of
      the stem narrows and becomes pointed, and the stem extends upward to
      become a highly branched inflorescence up to 60–200 cm (20–80 in)
      tall.<sup>[27]</sup>

    <h2>Chemistry</h2>
    <p>
      Polyacetylenes can be found in Apiaceae vegetables like carrots where they
      show cytotoxic activities.<sup>[29]</sup><sup>[30]</sup> Falcarinol and
      falcarindiol (cis-heptadeca-1,9-diene-4,6-diyne-3,8-diol)<sup>[31]</sup>
      are such compounds. This latter compound shows antifungal activity towards
      Mycocentrospora acerina and Cladosporium cladosporioides.[31] Falcarindiol
      is the main compound responsible for bitterness in carrots.<sup>[32]</sup>
    </p>
    <h2>Cultivation</h2>
    <p>
      Carrots are grown from seed and can take up to four months (120 days) to
      mature, but most cultivars mature within 70 to 80 days under the right
      conditions.<sup>[35]</sup> They grow best in full sun but tolerate some
      shade.<sup>[36]</sup> The optimum temperature is 16 to 21 °C (61 to 70
      °F).<sup>[37]</sup> The ideal soil is deep, loose and well-drained, sandy
      or loamy, with a pH of 6.3 to 6.8.<sup>[38]</sup>
    </p>
    <h3>Cultivation problems</h3>
    <p>
      There are several diseases that can reduce the yield and market value of
      carrots. The most devastating carrot disease is Alternaria leaf blight,
      which has been known to eradicate entire crops. A bacterial leaf blight
      caused by Xanthomonas campestris can also be destructive in warm, humid
      areas. Root knot nematodes (Meloidogyne species) can cause stubby or
      forked roots, or galls.<sup>[41]</sup> Cavity spot, caused by the
      oomycetes Pythium violae and Pythium sulcatum, results in irregularly
      shaped, depressed lesions on the taproots.<sup>[42]</sup>
    </p>
    <h3>Companion planting</h3>
    <p>
      Carrots benefit from strongly scented companion plants. The pungent odour
      of onions, leeks and chives help repel the carrot root
      fly,<sup>[38]</sup>and other vegetables that team well with carrots
      include lettuce, tomatoes and radishes, as well as the herbs rosemary and
      sage.<sup>[44]</sup> Carrots thrive in the presence of caraway, coriander,
      chamomile, marigold and Swan River daisy.<sup>[38]</sup> They can also be
      good companions for other plants; if left to flower, the carrot, like any
      umbellifer, attracts predatory wasps that kill many garden pests.<sup
